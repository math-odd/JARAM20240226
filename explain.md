# Java Class Inspection and Dependency Analysis Tool Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document describes the design of a program that analyzes Java classes and identifies their dependencies. This program aims to provide developers with a tool that can help them understand and maintain their code more easily.

## 2. Features

- **Class Analysis:** Analyzes all methods, fields, and constructors of a specified class.
- **Dependency Extraction:** Identifies other classes used by the class and generates a dependency graph.
- **Cyclic Dependency Detection:** Finds cyclic dependencies within the code and notifies the developer.
- **Unused Class Detection:** Identifies unused classes in the code and allows them to be removed.
- **Metric Calculation:** Calculates various metrics (e.g., coupling, cohesion) for classes and methods.
- **Result Visualization:** Visualizes dependency graphs and metric information.

## 3. Additional Features

- **JAR File Analysis:** Analyzes classes contained in JAR files and extracts dependencies.
- **Source Code Analysis:** Analyzes Java source code directly to extract dependencies.
- **Classpath Configuration:** Provides a feature to specify the target classes for analysis.
- **Exclusion List Configuration:** Provides a feature to configure classes or packages to be excluded from analysis.
- **Report Generation:** Generates analysis results in HTML or PDF format.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:**
    - Apache Commons: [https://commons.apache.org/](https://commons.apache.org/)
    - JavaParser: [https://javaparser.org/](https://javaparser.org/)
